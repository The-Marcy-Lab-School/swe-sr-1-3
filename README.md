## Prompt 2

The callback that you provide to forEach, filter, or map can include up to three parameters.

```js
const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];

arr.forEach((param1, param2, param2) => {

});
```

What values will be provided to those three parameters? To support your response, provide an example of how you might use all three parameters to do something.

## Prompt 3

According to our [style guide](https://marcylabschool.gitbook.io/marcy-lab-school-docs/fullstack-curriculum/cheatsheets/style-guide#iterators-and-generators) (adopted from AirBnb), it is recommended that you only use array higher-order functions like `forEach` instead of `for` loops.

What do you see as the benefit of doing this?

## Prompt 5
Imagine you are teaching a brand new programmer a brief lesson about callback functions. Your lesson should have the following components:
* An explanation of the concept with an analogy ("A callback function is a ... It is like a ...")
* An example of the syntax for a higher-order function that accepts a callback.
* An explanation of the syntax using the terms **callback**, **higher order function**

Below, we've provided an outline for your response but feel free to modify it as you see fit.

### Response 5
